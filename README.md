# Chase
 
Both the Player and enemies are controlled by AI using Behavior Trees; the armed Player actively pursues and shoots unarmed enemies, who independently roam the level at random, each displaying an HP bar above their heads. The UI provides options to customize game parameters, including party settings, speed, health, and shooting range
